# üß¨ Methylation Pipeline

This repository contains preprocessing and visualization tools for analyzing DNA methylation changes across treatment timepoints using filtered EMseq data. It is useful for following longitudinal studies.

## üîß Preprocessing Steps

These scripts help prepare your input methylation data.

### Step 1: Filter Methylation Files by Patient ID
- Script: `scripts/step_1_filter_patients_local.py`
- Applies to all methylation Excel files and a patient ID list.
- Filters large Excel files to retain only samples from selected patients.
- Outputs one filtered Excel file per original input in the output directory (e.g. `EMSeq-NN-Run-1_CG80_CH20_Tot10_Glob20_cpgi_counts.xlsx_samples-of-interest`)

#### üìÅ Input File Requirements
- One Excel file with patient IDs (e.g. `patient_list.xlsx`)
  - IDs must be in the first column.
- One or more methylation Excel files
  - Columns should contain patient IDs in their names.

These input files are used at the start of Step 1. Place them in a `data/` folder. Filtered outputs will be saved to an `output/` folder and will be needed for downstream analysis.

### Step 2 (Optional): Merge Filtered Files from Multiple EMseq Runs
- Script: `scripts/step_2_merge_filtered_files.py`
- Auto-detect file(s):
- Required only if you have `.xlsx` outputs from multiple different EMseq batches.
- Produces one merged file for unified analysis in the output directory (e.g. `merged_output_glob20.xlsx`, `merged_output_globmin80.xlsx`)

### Step 3: Convert to Aberrant Signals
- Script: `scripts/step_3_convert_to_aberrant_signals.py` 
- Auto-detect file(s):
- Takes the cpgi methylation fragment counts in Glob20 Excel files and divides them by corresponding values in GlobMin80 Excel files to create methylation fragment ratios. Then, scales those numbers up to >1 by multiplying 1000 each.
- Produces `scaled_fragment_ratios_matrix.xlsx` in the output directory.

### Step 4 (Optional): Annotate Genes
- Script: `scripts/step_4_generate_gene_annotation.py`
- Required only if you are going to run `scripts/locus/deltagene-heatmaps-lineplots-bothfonts-labels.py` later.
- Auto-detect file(s): an Excel file containing "matrix" in its name
- Reads an Excel file containing "matrix" in its name and processes its content to generate a CSV file with structured gene annotation data:
  - Extracts CGI names from the first column, filtering those starting with "CGI_".
  - Processes each CGI name by splitting it into parts and extracting chromosome, start and end genomic coordinates, gene names, and probe IDs.
- Produces `structured_gene_annotation.csv` in the output directory.

### Step 5 (Optional): Build a CGI Map
- Script: `scripts/step_5_build_gene_cgi_map.py`
- Required only if you are going to run `scripts/locus/deltagene-heatmaps-lineplots-bothfonts-labels.py` later.
- Auto-detect file(s): .xlsx and .csv files in the output directory that contain the term "gene_annotation" in their filename
  - You had to have run Step 4 of the Preprocessing Steps (`scripts/step_4_generate_gene_annotation.py`) for this file to have been generated in your output directory.
- Processes these files to create a mapping of genes to CGI identifiers:
  - The script selects the first file from the list of matching files and prints its name.
  - The script identifies all columns in the DataFrame that start with "Gene".
  - It reshapes the DataFrame into a long format where each row represents a gene and its associated CGI.
  - The script creates a cgi_id column in the format chr:start-end
  - The final gene_cgi_map DataFrame is created by selecting the cgi_id and gene_name columns and removing duplicates.
  - The script saves the gene_cgi_map DataFrame as a CSV file in the output directory.
- Generated file(s): `gene_cgi_map.csv` in the output directory

## üåê Global-Level (Patient / Timepoint) Analysis

This workflow focuses on overall methylation trends per patient or treatment condition.

### Generate Dotplots by Condition/Timepoint
- Script: `scripts/global/dotplots-by-condition.py`
- Auto-detect file(s): Excel file(s) located in the output directory that contains "fragment_ratios_matrix" in its name
  - You had to have run Step 3 of the Preprocessing Steps (scripts/step_3_convert_to_aberrant_signals.py) for this file to have been generated in your output directory.
- Data Processing Steps:
  - Classifies samples into conditions (Healthy, Baseline, On-Treatment, Post-Treatment).
  - Calculates summary statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation), and generates two types of scatter plots: Median Scatter Plot and Mean ¬± SD Scatter Plot.
- Generated file(s):
  - A CSV file containing summary statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation) for each condition is saved as `*_summary_stats.csv` in the plots/dotplots directory.
  - Resulting plots are saved as `*_median_dotplot.png` and `*_mean_sd_dotplot.png` in the plots/dotplots directory.

## üß† Additional Context: Data Annotation Format
A breakdown of CGI names (i.e. `CGI_chr1_778604_779167_LOC100288069_0`) can be done to interpret CGI identifiers:
- `CGI_` ‚Üí prefix 
- `chr1` ‚Üí chromosome
- `778604_779167` ‚Üí genomic coordinates
- `LOC100288069` ‚Üí gene name
- `_0` ‚Üí sometimes denotes CpG island index or probe ID

Hopefully, this helps you understand the CpG region labels.
